For reproduce the results or run the code, see [here](./docs/reproducibility.md).  

The output of the recommender system is the [output.ndjson](recommender-output.ndjson).  

The output was based only in a sample of the present users of the days `2017-12-04` and `2017-12-05` in the pdpviews file. The order of the recomendations is written in `item` field from the more likely to the less likely.
